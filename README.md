# JavaScript Practice Lab 🧪

A structured collection of **JavaScript fundamentals → advanced concepts**, organized as topic-based mini-repositories.

---

## 📖 What This Is

This repository serves as my long-term **reference library and practice ground** for core JavaScript concepts including:

- Variables and data types
- Conditionals and control flow
- Functions
- Arrays and objects
- String/number methods
- Higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Real-world, test-driven coding challenges

Each topic lives in its own sub-repository with:

- A dedicated `README.md`
- Isolated exercises and source code
- Its own `package.json` and test setup (where applicable)

This mirrors real-world project structure and makes it easy to revisit specific topics independently.

```

Each folder is a **self-contained JavaScript lab** focused on one core topic.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Build a strong foundation in JavaScript
- Practice **real-world problem solving**, not just syntax
- Learn to write:
  - Correct logic
  - Defensive input validation
  - Test-driven solutions
- Maintain a personal knowledge base I can revisit anytime
- Create a structured learning path from basics → advanced JavaScript

**This is not a single project — it's a learning system.**

## 🧠 How to Use This Repo

1. Pick a topic folder (e.g., `js-conditionals`)
2. Read that folder's `README.md`
3. Follow the setup instructions inside the sub-repo:

```bash
   cd js-conditionals
   npm install
   npm test
```

3. Erase the completed challenges in `src/`
4. Solve the challenges in `src/`
5. Move to the next topic when ready

Each sub-repo is designed to be worked on **independently**.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Most sub-repos require:

- Node.js v20+
- npm
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

Each lab documents its own setup and commands in its local `README.md`.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Practice Style

Most labs follow a **test-driven format**:

1. You start with **failing tests**
2. Implement logic in `src/`
3. Re-run tests until all pass

This enforces:

- Precise behavior
- Edge case handling
- Correct return types
- Clean function contracts

This mirrors **real-world engineering workflows**.

---

## 🧭 Why This Structure?

Instead of one massive repo with mixed topics, this layout:

- Keeps each concept **isolated and focused**
- Avoids dependency conflicts between topics
- Makes it easy to revisit a single topic later
- Matches how real-world codebases are modularized

**Think of this as a personal JavaScript curriculum.**

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each sub-repo is intentionally kept **independent**.
- The root repo acts as a **catalog + learning index**.
- This repo is for **learning and reference**, not production code.
